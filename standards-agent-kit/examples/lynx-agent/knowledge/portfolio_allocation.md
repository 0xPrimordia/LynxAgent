# Portfolio Allocation Strategies

## Balanced Approach
- Core allocation prioritizes ecosystem fundamentals
- Weight determination factors: market cap, liquidity, utility, ecosystem impact
- Regular review of weights by DAO governance

## Allocation Adjustments
- Major weight changes require governance approval
- Minor adjustments within allowed ranges can be done by rebalancer agent
- Adjustment frequency: major review quarterly, minor adjustments as needed

## Diversification Principles
- No single token should exceed 40% of portfolio
- Minimum of 5 tokens in the index at all times
- Both utility and governance tokens should be represented
